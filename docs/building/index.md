**Building is only required if you require a configuration not covered by the**
**automated builds, or if you want to contribute to the development of Dnkvw.**

## CMake

For building you must have at least CMake version 3.5 installed.

## OpenCV

The first step is to build and configure OpenCV 4.2.0. Newer versions might work, but were not tested.
It is generally not recommended to build Dnkvw with OpenCV as a shared dependency, since Dnkvw is easier to deploy with OpenCV included in the same .dll file. However, if you use Dnkvw in a context that
