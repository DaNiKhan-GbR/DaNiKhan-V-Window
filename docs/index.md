## About

DaNiKhan Virtual Window is a library that allows the easy creation of virtual reality applications that don't require the user to own a headset or other specialized hardware. The resulting application takes the users head movement into account to create a depth effect. For this to work the user only needs a standard webcam.

This library exposes an [C](https://danikhan-gbr.github.io/DaNiKhan-V-Window/TODO) 
and an [C++](https://danikhan-gbr.github.io/DaNiKhan-V-Window/TODO) Interface.

## Motiviation

This project was initiated by the VR Project at the [FH Wedel](https://www.fh-wedel.de/).
In 2007 Johnny Lee [demonstrated](https://youtu.be/Jd3-eiid-Uw) a functional prototype for a virtual window using a head mounted Wii remote sensor bar to track the user's head position.

Since then there have been many attempts to recreate or improve upon his solution.

This project aims to create a library enable an easier way to implement a similar virtual window 
using a standard webcam.

## Requirements

You need:
* OpenCV >= 4.2.0
* Cmake >= 3.5
* Webcam with at least 640x480px @ 30 fps

Tested on:
* Windows 10
